/**
 * @file index.ts
 * @description This file serves as a central export point for all shared utility functions.
 * Functions in this directory should be pure, reusable, and applicable across multiple features of the application.
 * Import specific functions here and export them to make them available throughout the app.
 * As the number of utilities grows, consider splitting them into separate files based on their purpose.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * import { formatDate, calculateTotal } from '@/shared/utils';
 */

// Example exports (uncomment and modify as needed):
// export { formatDate } from './dateUtils';
// export { calculateTotal } from './mathUtils';
// export { validateEmail } from './validationUtils';
